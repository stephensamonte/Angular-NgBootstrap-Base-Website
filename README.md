# Angular-NgBootstrap-Template-Website
Website template that uses ng Bootstra. 

In the future will have it's own fake data and mock server which can later be swapped out for real http requests. 

# Environment 
- This project is being edited using [Visual Stuid Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [GitBash Terminal](https://git-scm.com/downloads), [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/) (Command Line Interface), and [ng Bootstrap](https://ng-bootstrap.github.io/#/home).
- To run the project you have to install ng Bootstrap.

# Notes: 
- This is an [Angular Website](https://angular.io/)
- This project uses [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) via [ng Bootstrap](https://ng-bootstrap.github.io/#/home). I decided to implement bootstrap using ng bootstrap because it's a more streamline process than adding bootstrap without ng bootstrap. "Ng-Bootstrap contains a set of native Angular directives based on Bootstrap's markup and CSS. As a result no dependency on jQuery or Bootstrap's JavaScript is required."
